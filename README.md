# Challenge in Python
This challenge is from ***Platzi's Python course.***
In this course, I am learning about __computational thinking__, to apply it in *python* and in *different programming languages*.
The program will ask us for our name (which will be housed in the name variable), after it will show us a greeting with the name entered and finally, it will indicate the length of the greeting variable.
__Class challenge accomplished!__
